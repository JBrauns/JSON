# JSON Parser

This is a simple json parser i wrote the oop way. It is currently only basically tested so don't even think about using it for something serious at the moment. More Information about this project will be added soon.
As the json file format is not that extensive to write a complete parsers should not be that big of a problem.

Things todo:
- Testing/Adjusting for OS independece
- UTF string handling
- Writing lightweight and fast bare C version (stb library like)
